Cask for Emacs is what Bundler is to Ruby. It aims to make ELPA
dependency management in Emacs painless (as painless as it can
be). This includes both your local Emacs installation and Emacs
package development.

To install Cask, run this command:

```bash
$ curl -fsSkL https://raw.github.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
```

See <http://cask.github.io/> for more information and
